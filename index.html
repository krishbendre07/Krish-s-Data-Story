          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p class="lead">Every morning, thousands of students across Connecticut arrive at their school carrying more than just their backpacks. For some, it’s an untreated toothache, a prolonged cough, or something that is disturbing their mind. School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) were created to meet these needs by providing free or low-cost medical, dental, and mental health services to these children in schools. According to research in the Journal of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2023.00377"> Adolescent Health (“School Attendance,”)</a> SBHCs reduces school absences, improves learning conditions, and helps bridge the crucial gaps for families with limited access to healthcare. It is important to note that the SBHCs are different from a regular school nurse’s office, as they function as comprehensive primary care clinics staffed by medical professionals, and are not limited to providing first aid and basic health support.
</p>

          <p>But unfortunately, not every student has that access. The accessibility to SBHCs in Connecticut is largely dependent on where a student lives and attends school. One district may be operating multiple SBHCs, giving students quick access to preventive care, while a nearby district may offer none at all. This lack of equal access raises an important question: Where are the SBHCs located, and how accessible are they? Asking this challenges us to think about equity and ways policymakers can bring changes to bridge this gap in access. If the access to SBHCs improves students' academic performance, as well as attendance, then making SBHCs accessible becomes important; a goal shared by our community partner the <a href="https://ctschoolhealth.org/">Connecticut Association of School Based Health Centers</a> who work to strengthen and expand SBHC access statewide.</p>

          <p>This data story explores where SBHCs are located across Connecticut and how many students have access to them. It further explores how many students are left without access to these SBHCs that could potentially shape their health and learning for years to come. To understand these gaps, we used the best available statewide <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kk5gxK5PsrAX4efwMTl31gGkKmeey-4ZgXCxkOrmMv4/edit?usp=sharing">data</a> on SBHCs, Edsight School Reports, and Enrollment Data to map where SBHCs are and are not located, along with the students who have access to them (“Enrollment Report”). We found that there are about 340 schools that have SBHCs, and they are spread across over 220 school districts, with access unevenly distributed and mostly clustered heavily in the top 5 largest cities in Connecticut (Hartford, Bridgeport, Stamford, Waterbury, New Haven), while many suburban and rural districts have none at all.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Accessibility of SBHCs across Connecticut
</h2>

          <p>To see an overview of the accessibility of SBHCs across Connecticut, we calculated the number of students who have access to such services. By taking the total number of student enrollments in the year 2024-25 and comparing their school data, we can determine the overall disparity in access to school-based health services. The bar chart below gives a comprehensive view of the accessibility of SBHCs that highlights the direct number of students who benefit and those who are otherwise at a disadvantage.

          <h2>Analysing School-Level Access to SBHCs across Connecticut
</h2>

          <p>To understand these gaps in access, we compared all the schools in the state with the list of confirmed SBHC sites in our dataset. Out of the 2,000+ schools in our dataset, many lacked SBHCs despite being in districts where other schools offer the same services, thus creating unequal access even within the same school district. To visualize which schools do and do not offer SBHC services, we mapped every school in the state (best available data). Figure 2 below shows the distribution of schools across Connecticut, showing whether they do or do not offer SBHC services to students.
</p>

</p>

<p>With this visualization, it becomes clear that the gap in access is due to the majority of schools not offering SBHC services. With such limited schools offering such services, a student’s access to healthcare often depends on which school they attend, even within the same district. This means that two students in the same district could have very different access to preventive care and mental health services. It can also be noted in the map above that most of the schools with SBHCs are clustered around the 5 largest cities of the state, and are followed by urban centres, while several large rural and suburban regions have no access to schools that offer SBHC services to students at all.

          <h2>Understanding District-Level Accessibility of SBHCs across Connecticut
</h2>

          <p>As we move further into understanding the larger scope of access, rather than narrowing into individual schools, we zoom out from the school-level view to a district-level view to examine how SBHC access is distributed across Connecticut school districts. The table in Figure 3 shows which districts have SBHCs, how many are located in each district, the table also indicates school districts have none at all.
</p>

</p>

          <p>To better understand these patterns geographically, we translated this district-level data onto a map of Connecticut, shown in Figure 4 below. The choropleth map uses the Unified School District Map 2025, the most complete and consistent geographic boundary dataset currently available for statewide visualization. While this polygon layer does not capture every small or non-unified district with perfect precision, it remains the best available option for representing overall geographic trends. This map makes it easier to see regional concentrations, gaps, and the concentration of SBHCs in the school districts across Connecticut. In the map below, we see trends of SBHCs being clustered around large urban districts, with Hartford and New Haven being the darkest colored polygons, indicating higher SBHC counts. 
</p>
          
        <iframe title="Connecticut School Districts: Access to School-Based Health Centers" aria-label="Choropleth map" id="datawrapper-chart-K34HR" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/K34HR/17/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="735" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
        
       
       <p>Figure 4. Connecticut Districts with SBHC Totals. <a href='https://www.datawrapper.de/_/K34HR/?v=17'>Link to interactive map</a>.
</p>

<p>From the visualization above and the data in Figure.3, we can see that Hartford leads with 21 SBHCs serving 15,782 students, followed by New Haven with 20 centers serving 18,144 students. The visualization reveals a clear pattern of how the largest urban districts dominate SBHC distribution, while the vast majority of smaller and rural school districts have no access to SBHCs at all. It is easily visible that SBHCs in Connecticut are mostly concentrated in the five major cities – Hartford, Bridgeport, Waterbury, New Haven, and Stamford, and followed by other large urban districts. These five urban districts together have about one-fifth of all SBHCs in Connecticut. In contrast, most suburban and rural districts have no SBHC presence at all, creating large geographic gaps in school-based healthcare access.<p>

<p>While the largest cities have the highest number of SBHCs, they also carry the burden of having a significantly higher number of students who attend those schools. The higher number of SBHCs in these cities does not simply indicate greater funding or development, but it is largely driven by their high student populations. For example, while Hartford and New Haven have some of the largest numbers of SBHCs in the state, they also serve approximately 15,782 and 18,144 students, respectively. 
<p>

<p>Given that the SBHC counts are not solely related to urbanisation and development, but the actual enrolled population, using student enrollment as a criterion will help us better analyse the accessibility of school-based health services across Connecticut. Thus, using a metric of ‘SBHC-per-1000-students’ can reveal a different story to better understand how many students are actually getting access, and those who are void of it. 
<p>

<p>With the data from Figure.3, the map in Figure.5 below uses the metric ‘SBHCs per 1,000 students,’ which helps us to evaluate SBHC accessibility by accounting for both the number of SBHCs in each district and the corresponding student enrollment.
<p>

<p>Figure 5. Connecticut Districts with SBHCs per 1000 students. <a href='https://www.datawrapper.de/_/IkgBp/?v=12'>Link to interactive map</a>.
</p>

<p>The map reveals a new pattern that seems to contradict the earlier geographical trends that favoured the largest cities in Connecticut. Through this map, we see that several medium-sized districts actually offer better access per student, while the larger districts with a higher number of SBHCs fall much below. Districts of Hartford and New Haven, with large SBHC counts, have an access rate of 1.33 and 1.1 SBHCs per 1000 students, respectively, while districts such as Portland have a rate of 4.06, and Winchester a rate of 3.44 SBHCs per 1000 students. This therefore shows us that accessibility is not solely about the number of SBHCs but the number of students who are benefited in school districts. However, it is not always the case that districts with lower student populations are always accessible, because several smaller towns have rates that fall below 1 SBHC per 1000 students, and a fair number of districts are completely void of such health services. The absence of such important services raises concerns about regional equity and whether resources are being distributed where the needs are greatest or simply where systems already exist.<p>


<h4>Where Do We Go From Here?</h4>

<p>Taken together, these findings point to the need for a more calculated approach to the distribution and accessibility of School-Based Health Centers. Simply adding more centers would not guarantee better access if the student populations remain disproportionate in every district. Going forward and rethinking access, the per 1000 student rates can serve as a comprehensive tool for state agencies, districts, and community partners to identify the most inaccessible areas, especially the smaller towns that have no SBHC services at all. By directing future investment and funding toward regions with the greatest gaps, and not just the largest districts, Connecticut can move closer to a school-health infrastructure that is far more equitable, accessible, and focused on the actual needs.
<p>

<h4>Methods</h4>

<p>We began our analysis by cleaning our dataset of Connecticut School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) provided by our instructor, Jack Dougherty. This dataset identified which schools operate an SBHC, as well as the towns and districts in which these schools are located. We used XLOOKUP to match the schools with SBHCs and those without SBHCs. After that, we used “Yes” for schools that we found have SBHCs and “No” for those that do not have. 
<p>

<p>After preparing our cleaned dataset, we used pivot tables in Google Sheets to summarize school-level and district-level totals, calculate enrollment with and without SBHC access, and put all the data together for easier visualization. We imported the data into Datawrapper to create both the school-level and district-level maps, a symbol or point map showing school-level access, a choropleth showing district access patterns, and a sortable interactive table showing counts of SBHC in each district, enrollment, and SBHCs per 1,000 students. For the geographic mapping, we used the district boundary that our Professor gave us to get the boundary for the 5 largest cities in the state.
<p>

<p>However, some schools in our dataset were not listed in the EdSight enrollment data, and so we did not add them to our calculations. Also, our maps assume that students use the SBHC located in the school they attend. However, in real life, some students may receive care at a center outside their district. Our visualizations cannot fully capture these cross-district patterns, so actual access may differ slightly from what the map shows. But despite these uncertainties, the combined methods we used do provide a reliable foundation for understanding SBHC distribution and access across Connecticut.
